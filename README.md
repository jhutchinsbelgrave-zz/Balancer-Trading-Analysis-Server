# Balancer Labs Trading Analysis Tool Server Side
## Welcome to the Balancer Labs Trading Analysis tool

### Setting up Server
```
npm install
```

Also use this time to set up any env variables you might need. In this case, you'll need an "API_KEY" and a "PORT" for the port number.

I recommend using a ".env" file but honestly you can do it however works best for you!
### Running Server
```
node server.js
```
